Smartphone notifications are used to inform users of a variety of events for timely engagement. However, there are growing concerns about messaging behaviors in schools because frequent in-class checking and responding may hinder students' learning. This study deepened our understanding of in-class instant messaging behaviors and their impacts on academic performance by analyzing a large-scale smartphone usage dataset collected from 84 first-year college students for 14 weeks. We quantified notification arrival and checking patterns in classrooms and analyzed how notification handling behaviors were related to students' smartphone usage and academic performance. Our results showed that message arrivals and checking  frequently happen even during class. Frequent checking behaviors were positively related to longer, diverse app usage, and willful neglect of incoming messages was positively related to overall academic performance. Our work provides evidence of problematic behaviors related to instant message handling in learning contexts and calls for further studies in devising effective intervention mechanisms.
